# TimedEventB
The plugin **TimedEventB** permits to specify timing properties on Event-B models. These properties are mainly attached to tasks represented as Event-B events. We distinguish two timing proprty kinds:
1. Mono-task properties: these properties include _duration_, _periodicity_ and _speration. _
   a. **Duration**
3. Bi-task properties: these properties mainly denote ordering properties like _followed _and _preceded.___
